# IH-QuoteoftheDay

<p style="font-size: 18px">
Internet Hippo's Quote of the Day is a back-end interface built with Node.js and Express that allows people to add their phone numbers to receive a quote of the day via SMS (via Twilio). This app also allows the administrator to change and send the QotD, to add and edit quotes, and reset the database to allow quotes to be resused in future years.
<br />
The project was originally built as part of MLH's Sharkhacks 3.
